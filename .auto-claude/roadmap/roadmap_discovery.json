    "pain_points": ["Z.AI API lacks OpenAI/Anthropic compatibility", "Need for per-user rate limiting and quota management", "No built-in multi-user support in direct Z.AI API", "Difficulty tracking token usage across multiple users", "Need for proxy/gateway to abstract AI provider specifics"],
    "goals": ["Integrate GLM models using familiar OpenAI/Anthropic API formats", "Manage multiple users with individual API keys and quotas", "Monitor and control token usage to prevent cost overruns", "Deploy a reliable gateway with rate limiting and health checks", "Maintain compatibility with existing AI/LLM application code"],

    "one_liner": "An OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible API gateway for Z.AI's GLM models with multi-user token-based rate limiting and quota management",
    "problem_statement": "Z.AI's GLM models (like glm-4.7) require custom API integration, making it difficult for developers to use them with existing AI/LLM tools and libraries that expect OpenAI or Anthropic API formats. Additionally, there's no built-in way to manage multiple users, track usage, or enforce rate limiting.",
    "value_proposition": "GLM Proxy provides a drop-in replacement for OpenAI/Anthropic APIs that routes requests to Z.AI's GLM models, enabling developers to use their existing code and tools while gaining enterprise-grade features like per-user API keys, token-based rate limiting with rolling 5-hour windows, usage tracking, and multi-tenancy support.",

    "technical_debt": ["File-based storage (apikeys.json) doesn't scale for high concurrency", "In-memory rate limiting doesn't support distributed deployments", "No structured logging (only console.log)", "Manual API key management prone to errors", "Limited test coverage for edge cases", "No integration tests", "No API versioning strategy"]
