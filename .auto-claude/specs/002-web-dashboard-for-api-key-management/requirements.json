  "task_description": "# Web Dashboard for API Key Management\n\nA simple, responsive web UI for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting API keys without manual JSON editing. Includes real-time usage visualization and quota monitoring.\n\n## Rationale\nCurrent manual JSON editing is error-prone and requires technical expertise. A web UI makes API key management accessible to all team members and addresses competitor pain points about complexity (Portkey, Azure APIM). Reduces operational overhead for administrators.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a system administrator, I want to create and manage API keys through a web interface so that I don't have to manually edit JSON files\n- As a team lead, I want to view real-time usage statistics for all team members so that I can monitor quota consumption\n- As a non-technical user, I want to reset my own API key through a simple UI so that I don't need to contact IT staff\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can create new API keys through web form with validation\n- [ ] Users can view all API keys in table format with sorting/filtering\n- [ ] Users can edit existing key properties (name, quota, expiry, model)\n- [ ] Users can delete API keys with confirmation dialog\n- [ ] Real-time display of token usage and remaining quota\n- [ ] Dashboard is responsive and works on mobile devices\n- [ ] Authentication required to access dashboard (basic auth or token)\n- [ ] API key changes take effect immediately without service restart\n",
