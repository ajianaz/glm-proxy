      "description": "Implemented LRU cache with doubly-linked list and Map for O(1) operations. Doubly-linked list tracks access order with head (most recent) and tail (least recent). On every get() that hits, entry is moved to front. On every set(), new entries go to front. When maxSize is reached, tail is evicted. TTL is checked lazily on every get() operation - expired entries are deleted and counted as misses.",
