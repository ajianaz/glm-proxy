    "gotchas_discovered": [
      "Long-running tests (1 hour sustained load) require efficient memory management",
      "High concurrency scenarios (1000+ users) need careful resource cleanup",
      "Async test execution requires proper cancellation mechanisms",
      "Real-time metrics collection should not introduce significant overhead",
      "Network timeouts and failures need graceful handling without test crashes",
      "File system operations for reports must handle concurrent access",
      "Memory monitoring needs to be non-blocking and minimal overhead"

    "approach_outcome": {
      "methodology": "Created comprehensive load testing framework with 7 distinct scenarios covering all aspects of performance validation",
      "implementation": "Successfully delivered all acceptance criteria with 6 core files plus test suite, real-time monitoring, automated reporting, and CLI interface",
      "validation": "All 15 tests passing with performance targets met (P50<10ms, P95<15ms, P99<25ms, Memory<100MB, ErrorRate<5%)",
