- Excellent memory efficiency (93.7% under target)
- Poor scaling under high concurrency
- Identified primary bottlenecks: no connection pooling, no HTTP/2, JSON overhead

- Created 46 comprehensive tests (all passing)
- All acceptance criteria met ✅

### Configuration Targets
- Target latency overhead: < 10ms
- Target base memory: < 100MB
- Default pool size: 10 connections

### Next Steps
1. **Phase 2 Complete**: All connection pool and network optimization subtasks completed
2. **Phase 3 In Progress**: JSON & Serialization Optimization
   - Subtask 3.1 (JSON Parser Integration) ✅ COMPLETED
   - Next: Subtask 3.2 (Request Body Streaming) - will use streaming JSON parser from 3.1
   - Then: Subtask 3.3 (Optimized JSON Transformation) - minimize parse/stringify cycles
3. Integrate PipeliningManager into ConnectionPool for true HTTP/2 multiplexing
4. Benchmark overall latency improvement after Phase 3 completion (target: < 10ms)
