### Recent Work
**Subtask 1.1: Create Benchmark Suite** ✅ COMPLETED
- Created comprehensive benchmarking framework
- Implemented latency measurement (p50, p95, p99 percentiles)
- Implemented throughput testing at multiple concurrency levels
- Implemented memory usage tracking
- Implemented CPU usage monitoring
- Added JSON result export functionality
- Created CLI interface with configurable options
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Created documentation (README.md)
- Added `bun run benchmark` script to package.json

**Subtask 1.2: Baseline Performance Measurement** ✅ COMPLETED
- Created run-baseline.ts script for automated baseline measurement
- Established comprehensive performance baseline
- Measured latency: 67.27ms mean (target: <10ms) - ❌ FAIL
- Measured throughput: Peak 12,621 RPS at concurrency 10
- Measured memory: 6.30MB base (target: <100MB) - ✅ PASS
- Measured CPU: 0.000387s average - ✅ PASS
- Identified scaling efficiency: 0.7% (target: >70%)
- Created detailed baseline report with optimization roadmap
- Added mock upstream server for testing
- Updated proxy.ts to support ZAI_API_BASE environment variable

**Key Findings:**
- High latency overhead (6.7x over target) - critical bottleneck
- Excellent memory efficiency (93.7% under target)
- Poor scaling under high concurrency
- Identified primary bottlenecks: no connection pooling, no HTTP/2, JSON overhead

### Next Steps
1. Subtask 1.3: Add profiling instrumentation to codebase
2. Begin Phase 2: Connection Pool & Network Optimization
3. Implement connection pool (expected: 30-50ms latency reduction)

### Configuration Targets
- Target latency overhead: < 10ms
- Target base memory: < 100MB
- Default pool size: 10 connections
- Default cache size: 1000 keys
