  "task_description": "# Performance Optimization and Low-Latency Architecture\n\nComprehensive performance optimization including connection pooling, request pipelining, efficient JSON parsing, and minimal overhead to achieve < 10ms latency overhead (beating LiteLLM's 15-30ms).\n\n## Rationale\nDirectly addresses LiteLLM's high latency pain point (pain-1-1). Major competitive differentiator. Critical for user experience in high-throughput applications. Aligns with market trend of moving away from high-latency gateways.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want low latency overhead so that my applications feel responsive\n- As a performance engineer, I want benchmarks so that I can compare GLM Proxy to alternatives\n- As a user, I want the proxy to be faster than competing solutions so that I choose GLM Proxy\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Latency overhead < 10ms measured from proxy request to Z.AI request\n- [ ] Connection pooling to Z.AI API with configurable pool size\n- [ ] Efficient streaming implementation with minimal buffering\n- [ ] Optimized JSON parsing and serialization\n- [ ] Profiling and benchmarking suite to track performance\n- [ ] Performance comparison dashboard vs direct Z.AI API\n- [ ] Load testing results showing sustained performance under load\n- [ ] Memory usage optimization (< 100MB base memory)\n- [ ] CPU usage profiling to identify hotspots\n",
