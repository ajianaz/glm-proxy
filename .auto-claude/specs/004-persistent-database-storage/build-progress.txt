# Build Progress: Persistent Database Storage

**Started:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** In Progress - Phase 1

## Overview
Replacing file-based storage with SQLite/PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM for horizontal scaling and production readiness.

## Phase Status

### Phase 1: Database Setup & Schema Design [IN PROGRESS]
- ✅ Install Drizzle ORM and drivers (COMPLETED: 1.1)
- ✅ Create configuration (COMPLETED: 1.2)
- Define schema matching ApiKey interface
- Create connection module

### Phase 2: Database Operations [PENDING]
- CRUD operations
- Usage tracking with transactions
- Statistics queries
- Helper functions

### Phase 3: Storage Abstraction [PENDING]
- Define IStorage interface
- Database adapter
- File storage adapter refactor
- Storage factory
- Update existing code

### Phase 4: Migration Tool [PENDING]
- CLI migration script
- Backup before migration
- Validation
- Rollback capability
- npm scripts

### Phase 5: Backup & Restore [PENDING]
- SQLite backup
- PostgreSQL backup
- Restore functionality
- CLI commands
- Scheduled backups

### Phase 6: Health Checks & Error Handling [PENDING]
- Health check function
- Connection retry logic
- Graceful degradation
- Error handling
- HTTP health endpoint

### Phase 7: Testing [PENDING]
- Schema tests
- CRUD tests
- Usage tracking tests
- Migration tests
- Backup/restore tests
- Storage abstraction tests
- Health check tests
- Integration tests

### Phase 8: Documentation [PENDING]
- Update README
- Migration guide
- Backup/restore docs
- Configuration examples
- API documentation

## Key Decisions
- Using Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Storage abstraction for backward compatibility
- Transaction-based operations for consistency
- Environment-based storage selection

## Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Install dependencies (drizzle-orm, postgres driver)~~
2. ✅ ~~Set up Drizzle configuration~~
3. Define database schema (NEXT: 1.3)
4. Implement database operations

## Completed Tasks
- **1.1** Install Drizzle ORM and drivers
  - Installed drizzle-orm@0.45.1
  - Installed postgres@3.4.8
  - Installed drizzle-kit@0.31.8 (dev dependency)
  - Verified bun:sqlite (built-in) is available
  - All dependencies installed successfully
- **1.2** Create Drizzle configuration
  - Created drizzle.config.ts with dual database support
  - Environment-based selection (DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL, DATABASE_PATH for SQLite)
  - Configured schema folder (./src/db/schema.ts) and migration output (./drizzle)
  - Added better-sqlite3 dev dependency for drizzle-kit compatibility
  - Updated .env.example with database configuration documentation
  - TypeScript compilation verified
