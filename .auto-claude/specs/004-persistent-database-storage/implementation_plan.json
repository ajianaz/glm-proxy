  "feature": "Persistent Database Storage",
  "description": "# Persistent Database Storage\n\nReplace file-based storage with SQLite or PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM for API keys, usage data, and configuration. Includes migration tool and data backup/restore functionality.\n\n## Rationale\nCurrent file-based storage doesn't support high concurrency and prevents horizontal scaling. Database enables multiple instances to share state and is critical for production deployments. Addresses major technical debt.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a production engineer, I want database-backed storage so that we can scale horizontally with multiple instances\n- As a DevOps engineer, I want automatic backups so that we don't lose API key data\n- As a developer, I want easy migration from file-based to database storage so that upgrading is seamless\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] SQLite support for simple deployments (zero external dependencies)\n- [ ] PostgreSQL support for production deployments\n- [ ] Migration tool to convert existing apikeys.json to database\n- [ ] Database schema supports all current API key fields\n- [ ] Database operations use transactions for consistency\n- [ ] Connection pooling for performance\n- [ ] Backup and restore functionality\n- [ ] Database health checks and connection error handling\n- [ ] Backward compatibility with file-based storage during transition period",
