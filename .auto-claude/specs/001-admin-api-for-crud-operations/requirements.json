  "task_description": "# Admin API for CRUD Operations\n\nRESTful API endpoints for programmatic API key management including create, read, update, delete operations with proper authentication and authorization.\n\n## Rationale\nEnables automation, integration with existing tools, and programmatic key management. Critical for DevOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines. Addresses gap where users must manually edit files.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a DevOps engineer, I want to automate API key provisioning through scripts so that I can integrate with our user onboarding system\n- As a developer, I want to programmatically manage test API keys so that I can automate test environment setup\n- As an integrator, I want to call an API to manage keys so that I can build custom tooling on top of GLM Proxy\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] POST /admin/api/keys - Create new API key with validation\n- [ ] GET /admin/api/keys - List all API keys with pagination\n- [ ] GET /admin/api/keys/:id - Get specific API key details\n- [ ] PUT /admin/api/keys/:id - Update API key properties\n- [ ] DELETE /admin/api/keys/:id - Delete API key\n- [ ] Admin API requires master API key or separate admin token\n- [ ] API returns proper HTTP status codes and error messages\n- [ ] Operations are atomic and prevent race conditions\n",
