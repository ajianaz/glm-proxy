  "task_description": "# Integration Test Suite\n\nComprehensive integration tests covering all API endpoints, rate limiting behavior, streaming responses, error scenarios, and multi-user interactions.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses technical debt of no integration tests. Ensures reliability and prevents regressions. Critical for production confidence and distinguishes from competitors with buggy implementations (Portkey).\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want integration tests so that I can confidently make changes without breaking functionality\n- As a maintainer, I want automated tests in CI/CD so that pull requests are automatically validated\n- As a user, I want reliable software so that I don't encounter unexpected bugs\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Tests cover all API endpoints (/v1/chat/completions, /v1/messages, /stats, /health)\n- [ ] Tests verify rate limiting enforcement with rolling window\n- [ ] Tests validate streaming responses for both OpenAI and Anthropic formats\n- [ ] Tests verify error handling for all error types\n- [ ] Tests check authentication and authorization\n- [ ] Tests validate API key expiry handling\n- [ ] Tests verify concurrent request handling\n- [ ] Tests can be run in CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] Test coverage report available\n- [ ] Tests complete in under 60 seconds\n",
